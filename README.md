============

In progress... I am initially working on a basic two player chess game in python. Once I have finished ascii version I may make a better UI for it.  I hope to be able to create an AI version of this in the future to allow for one player games as well. I will start by collecting a record of all moves / outcomes on every game to start to build data that can be used for probabilistic models in the AI.
