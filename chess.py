##  N O T E S :
##  =========
##  
##  Moves:
##    - all poss combs created against each piece;
##    - filter from there based on conditions, check etc;
##    - make process for user turns / instructions
##    - write info to database (for future AI data):
##      - just get all raw data here (incl possible moves?):
##        - feature engineering can then be done in batch to enrich data e.g.:
##          - move preceding a take (on which side / by how many moves)
##          - other performance metrics e.g. short, mid and long term prospects after 
##            move, i.e. how overall position in game improved / declined over next 
##            x, y, z moves and who eventually won.
##          - move direction
##          - piece value
##          - some measure of the moves risk level?


##  Design:
##    - any better way to factor in conditions (on_first etc.) inline with OO style


##  Features:
##    - consider option to list legal moves for a piece
##    - help feature to list shortcuts / features etc.


##  Performance:
##    - load all possible moves for each player at the start of each turn so that
##      they are already know by the time the player comes to move?
##      - if doing this would need a keyboardinterupt exception e.g.
##        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7180914/pause-resume-a-python-script-in-middle
##        to pick up cases when the user was ready to make their move before all 
##        possible moves had been pre-loaded (then just get moves for the piece they
##        select.)
##    - consider concept of piece type so that each type on parses it's moves etc once?
##    - move occupied list to get once per turn
##    - maybe pass occupied into steps function to stop looping once an occiped cell has 
##      cell has been reached?


##  Strategy:
##  maybe I should reconsider approach of calculating all moves allowed?
##  - computationally expensive:
##    - O = MSP (M = valid moves for piece; S = intermediate steps; P = occipied cells;)
##      just for blocking checks
##    - checking if a move puts king in check would also be huge as you would need to
##      consider: 
##      - all of the moves that may be made by each piece on other team (or shorten by
##        checking just if the move from each piece to where King is is possible)
