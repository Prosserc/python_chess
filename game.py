##  N O T E S :
##  =========

##  Performance:
##    - load all possible moves for each player at the start of each turn so 
##      that they are already know by the time the player comes to move?
##      - if doing this would need a keyboardinterupt exception???
##        To pick up cases when the user was ready to make their move before  
##        all possible moves had been pre-loaded (then just get moves for the 
##        piece they select) e.g.:
##http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7180914/pause-resume-a-python-script-in-middle
##    - LOGGING needs to be fully written (lazy implementation at present)

##  Bugs:
##    - prompt not re-prompting for invalid input
##    - automated game - King seems to put itself in check with pawns (found
##      cause - game object is not updated after moves - need to make copies).
##    - option to draw board for automated game.



## new comments:
##   - need to split off all console related stuff (so that it uses some UI that provides
##     some functions etc and console can be replaced with a GUI that provides the same..
##     - parse prompt
##     - print(board display) etc
##     - take concept of positions away from board? (implement bitboard?)
